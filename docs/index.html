			<p>I am an undergraduate student currently pursuing my degree at COEP Technological University, Pune. I entered into the world of computer-science by learning C and nowadays have also developed a bit of a taste for web-developement. Since I'm still learning, the website is in developement stage too, and always will be, as it is rightly said <em>"The only <strong>CONSTANT</strong> is <strong>CHANGE</strong>"</em>. That's all about me for now!</p>
